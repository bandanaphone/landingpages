Landing Pages by bandanaphone

This is my repository for hand-coded landing pages or website concepts. You can find the page <a href="https://bandanaphone.github.io/landingpages/">at this link</a>. I don't plan on building whole, feature-filled pages here, just concepts. Anyone is free to take whatever they see here and use as they wish.
